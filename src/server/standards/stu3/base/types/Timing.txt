Timing
event	Σ	0..*	dateTime	When the event occurs

repeat	ΣI	0..1	TimingRepeat	When the event is to occur
+ If there's an offset, there must be a when (and not C, CM, CD, CV)
+ period SHALL be a non-negative value
+ If there's a periodMax, there must be a period
+ If there's a durationMax, there must be a duration
+ If there's a countMax, there must be a count
+ if there's a duration, there needs to be duration units
+ If there's a timeOfDay, there cannot be be a when, or vice versa
+ if there's a period, there needs to be period units
+ duration SHALL be a non-negative value
